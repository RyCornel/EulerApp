Although it has not been proven yet (The Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

The EulerApp strives to contribute towards the evidence of proof, that The Collatz Problem is correct.

A user inputs any number they wish, upon tapping the "view results" button, The Collatz formula is executed and displays the results.
